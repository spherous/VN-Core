Tom: I haven’t enjoyed one bite of this dinner because of your constant directions on how to eat it. It’s you that makes me rush through meals with your hawk-like attention to every bite I take. Sickening – spoils my appetite – all of the discussion of – animals’ secretion – salivary glands – mastication!
Amanda: Temperament like a Metropolitan star!
TOM rises and crosses downstage.
Amanda: You’re not excused from the table.
Tom: I’m getting a cigarette.
Amanda: You smoke too much.
LAURA rises.
Laura: I’ll bring in the blancmange. 
TOM remains standing with his cigarette by the portieres during the following.
