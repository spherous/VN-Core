Estragon: Nothing to be done.
Vladimir: I'm beginning to come round to that opinion. All my life I've tried to put it from me, saying Vladimir, be reasonable, you haven't yet tried everything. And I resumed the struggle. So there you are again.
Estragon: Am I?
Vladimir: I'm glad to see you back. I thought you were gone forever.
Estragon: Me too.
Vladimir: Together again at least! We'll have to celebrate this. But how?
Vladimir: Get up till I embrace you.
Estragon: Not now, not now.
Vladimir: May one inquire where His Highness spent the night?
Estragon: In a ditch.
Vladimir: A ditch! Where?
Estragon: Over there.
